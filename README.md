# VolumetricRayCasting
This project will create a Unity toolkit that lets users toy around with primitive shapes generated by ray marching. The benefits of ray marched objects are real time generated meshes that can be added, subtracted, and blended with other shapes.

# Pull Log

### Basic raymarching functionality
https://github.com/Kobakat/VolumetricRayCasting/commit/b41208952c0fa814890e67ebf4837fdd25acabea

This pull implements the basic function of volumetric ray marching. The corners of the view frustum are calculated and then passed to a shader that casts a ray for every pixel on the scene. If the ray comes close enough to a shape's bounds that we define, we hit the object so we color the pixel.

### Shape normal and lighting calculator
https://github.com/Kobakat/VolumetricRayCasting/commit/7e807c3a10075ef6941b5ef4e1146f3a68ac3447

This pull calculates the normal vector of the pixel on the surface of the object. A lambertian lighting model is then applied to the shape. Additionally, the rest of the scene now renders behind (and only behind) the ray marched object.

### Application of depth buffer
https://github.com/Kobakat/VolumetricRayCasting/commit/b6bf78c364cdc98cbed5a192339ff7c144bd5d44

This pull fixes the problem of ray marched objects always rendering on top of other meshes. A depth buffer is taken from the camera and given to the raymarch shader to determine if the ray from any given pixel needs to break early because it reaches another mesh.
